  <h2 id="25-minute-talks">25 Minute Talks</h2>

  <p>25 minute talks may highlight a particular contribution or summarize an
    investigation or thought experiment.

  <p>We'd like to use these slots to:
  <ul>
    <li>Celebrate and bring awareness to community initiatives
    <li>Enable and improve community members' productivity and happiness
    <li>Inspire discussion with short-form analysis and commentary
  </ul>

  <p>Here are some examples of topics we would love to see proposed:
  <ul>
    <li>Demo and explain a PostgreSQL feature you developed
    <li>Share a new community initiative you started
    <li>Explain new features you added to a community resource (like the <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org" target="_blank">Commitfest app</a>)
    <li>Share how your open source community solved a systemic problem
    <li>Talk about PostgreSQL's top non-code contribution needs
    <li>Show how to use <a href="https://rr-project.org" target="_blank"><kbd>rr</kbd></a> to debug an issue in PostgreSQL
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="50-minute-talks">50 Minute Talks</h2>

  <p>50 minute talks should have a story arc. These may introduce new research,
    share hard-won learnings, showcase proof-of-concept solutions, present
    fresh analysis of an issue, or educate the community on a non-obvious issue.

  <p>Some of the high level categories:
  <ul>
    <li>Failed PostgreSQL projects and what you learned from them
    <li>Proof-of-concept features and performance improvements
    <li>Academic database research
    <li>Long-form surveys and analyses of PostgreSQL problems
    <li>Architectural issues in PostgreSQL and how to fix them
    <li>New perspectives on systemic community concerns
    <li>Educational content and how-tos
    <li>Missing features and user needs
  </ul>

  <p>Here are some specific examples of 50-minute talks we would love to see proposed:
  <ul>
    <li>Ideas for improving PostgreSQL's buffer replacement algorithm
    <li>Every performance bottleneck you've found this year and how you found them
    <li>Improving PostgreSQL's analytic workload support
    <li>Analysis of top complaints against PostgreSQL on Stack Overflow and how to fix them
    <li>How to use every PostgreSQL developer extension
    <li>Operating system concepts for the PostgreSQL developer
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="alternative-content">Alternative Content</h2>

  <p>Alternative Content encompasses activities and content that don't fit
    neatly in a 25 or 50 minute talk format, e.g. panels, interactive content,
    trainings, summits, microconferences, outreach events, and special interest
    sessions. This is an opportunity for community building.

  <p>Your proposal should include a detailed description of the content, a list
    of materials and resources needed, and a description of the target
    audience.

  <p>Some examples of alternative content that we may find interesting:
  <ul>
    <li>Panel discussion on a community-building topic like mental health
    <li>Student outreach breakfast
    <li>Extension Ecosystem Summit
    <li>Community organizing microconference
    <li><abbr title="Ask Me Anything">AMA</abbr> with PostgreSQL contributors
      on overcoming setbacks
    <li>Live coding session
    <li>Silent auction for charity
    <li>PostgreSQL run/walk
    <li>PostgreSQL Women coffee break
  </ul>

  <p>The number of alternative content proposals we accept will be based on
    their format, resource requirements, and scheduling constraints.

  <hr>

  <h2>Submission Notes</h2>

  <p>A talk may be proposed as both a 50 minute talk and 25 minute talk. Submit
    one copy of the proposal under the 50 minute track and another copy under
    the 25 minute track.  In the body of the proposal, explain which length you
    prefer. Alternative content may only be proposed to the alternative content
    track.

  <p>While you may propose content with multiple speakers, 50 minute talks
    receive, at most, two complimentary registrations. 25 minute talks receive
    one complimentary registration. And alternative content creators will
    receive subsidized registration on a case-by-case basis.

  <h3>Tips</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Proposed talks about your company's product are unlikely to be accepted
      unless they discuss issues encountered and how PostgreSQL could be
      modified to make it easier to extend and support.
    <li>Be sure to focus your bio on what makes you uniquely positioned to
      deliver the content you are proposing.
    <li>Proposed content with a goal of creating consensus around a topic
      like a summit or microconference is more likely to be accepted if it
      is co-proposed by individuals from multiple companies.
    <li>Check out the PGConf.dev 2024
      <a href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2024/schedule/" target="_blank">schedule</a>
      to see what we accepted and for more inspiration.
